# List of devices to monitor
#
# Devices can be defined either by device path or SAS address (or both)
# Defining by SAS address is more stable across reboots (and recommended)
# SAS addresses can be obtained by e.g. using the "lsscsi" utility ("-t")
#
# If defined by SAS address, the devices are resolved to their "/dev" paths
# at the begin of the program (can be tested with "sesmon test <config.yaml>")
# SAS address resolves using: "/sys/class/scsi_generic/sg*/device/sas_address"

  # Device 1 - resolve by SAS address (recommended)
